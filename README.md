# About

[Sentiment analysis](https://monkeylearn.com/sentiment-analysis/)¬†is a¬†[machine learning](https://monkeylearn.com/machine-learning/)¬†tool that analyzes texts for polarity, from positive to negative. By training machine learning tools with examples of emotions in text, machines automatically learn how to detect sentiment without human input.

To put it simply, machine learning allows computers to learn new tasks without being expressly programmed to perform them. Sentiment analysis models can be trained to read beyond mere definitions, to understand things like, context, sarcasm, and misapplied words. For example:

*‚ÄúSuper user-friendly interface. Yeah right. An engineering degree would be helpful.‚Äù*

Out of context, the words ‚Äòsuper user-friendly‚Äô and ‚Äòhelpful‚Äô could be read as positive, but this is clearly a negative comment. Using sentiment analysis, computers can automatically process text data and understand it just as a human would, saving hundreds of employee hours.

# Vision / Description

### Overview

From a high-level, our goal is to create a functional web app that can be used by anyone to evaluate sentiments of specific things from websites or social media sites.

Examples: YouTube video comments, Twitter threads, Reddit posts, etc

Continuing on from the Vision section. 

### Getting a little more in-depth

The web app will need to have the following basic functionalities at minimum:

- Text input (link and/or single line statement)
- Web scraper/parser
- Sentiment analysis implementation

The basic flow from a user's perspective will be as follows:

 Enter Input ‚Üí Receive % values for positive, negative, etc ‚Üí repeat


# Requirements

- Python
- Django
- Firebase *[TBD]*
- Google Cloud Services *[TBD]*

*[more TBD as needed]*

# *Icing on top* addons

If time permits, we can work on some cool features that will give the project some extra kick!

- Share functionality
    
    Allow people to share to their choice of social media the results they found through our web app
    
- Better styling
    
    We are not going to focus on UI too much at first, so this is defiantly something we can come back to
